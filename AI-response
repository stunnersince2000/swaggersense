Based on the provided request and response details, I'll expand the base Swagger YAML into a complete OpenAPI-compliant YAML. Here it is:

This OpenAPI definition includes two endpoints: `/pet` and `/bank`. The `/pet` endpoint accepts a POST request with a JSON body containing `pet` and `Animal` properties. The response includes a 200 status code with a success message, and a 400 status code with an error message.

The `/bank` endpoint also accepts a POST request with a JSON body containing a `bank` property. The response includes three possible status codes: 200 with a success message, 201 with a creation message, and 400 with an error message.

Note that I've used the `text/plain` media type for the response bodies, assuming that the responses will be simple text messages. If the responses will contain more complex data, you may need to adjust the `content` section accordingly.
